# Personal Website Development Project

- Build a personal website using HeroUI framework that can be deployed to Github Pages
- Use `vite` and `yarn` as frontend development tools
- Navbar currently contains only `Resume` and `Portfolio` pages, clicking the brand LOGO returns to `Home` page
- Other custom pages have been removed, current three routes: `Home (/)`, `Resume (/resume)`, `Portfolio (/portfolio)`
