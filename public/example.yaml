    publisher: "IEEE International Conference on LLM-Aided Design (IEEE ICLAD)"
    releaseDate: "2025"
    website: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22990"
    summary: >
      Proposing MenTeR, a novel multi-agent AI workflow that automates and accelerates end-to-end RF/analog circuit design by reducing trial-and-error and expanding design space exploration, laying the foundation for future AI-assisted analog design tools.

  - name: "A Leakage Analysis Methodology Considering Intra-Cell and Inter-Cell Layout Dependent Effects"
    url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546410
    publisher: "2024 International VLSI Symposium on Technology, Systems and Applications (VLSI TSA)"
    releaseDate: "2024"
    summary: >
      A methodology for digital logic IP-level leakage analysis that incorporates both intra-cell and inter-cell layout-dependent effects as well as cell abutment information. This approach improves pre-silicon leakage estimation accuracy, reducing the gap with post-silicon measurements by more than 10%, especially for mixed-Vt digital designs.
